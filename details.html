    <h2>Scripture Alone for Theology</h2>
    <p>
      It is crucial for Christians to draw their theology from Scripture alone. Scripture is the final and only authority in all matters of the faith, including formulating theology. Many theological systems have emphasized logic and philosophy over exegesis. Personal feelings and devotion to theological traditions often hinder believers from letting Scripture speak for itself. This results in the forcing of a system on the text, rather than the formation of a system from the text.
    </p>
    <p>
      CROCUS is a Biblically faithful, exegetically sourced, and text-saturated theology. Every one of the six points is woven throughout the pages of Scripture and is not based on logic or a theological tradition. Though CROCUS is a system, it is tied to Scripture and cannot be divorced from it. It is not meant to be merely academic or classroom focused but is inherently practical and pastoral in nature. The system within itself is not important, but the Scripture that gives birth to it. The glorious Biblical truths that CROCUS highlights should be a cause for great joy, gratitude, humility, and holy living on the part of those who have experienced them.

    <h2>Comprehensive Depravity</h2>
    <p>
      Man is affected by sin in every part of his person. Mind, will, and emotions are all affected and there is no “island of righteousness” in him untouched by sin. Fallen man is dead in sin (Ephesians 2:1), hates God (Romans 1:30), and does not do anything that is good according to God’s perfect standard (Romans 3:10-12). God sees not only the outward act but the motive and heart of the person doing it. Unregenerate man is unable to understand spiritual truth (1 Corinthians 2:14) and is further blinded by the god of this world (2 Corinthians 4:4). As a result, he is incapable of responding to the gospel message in a positive way, (repenting and believing), unless God the Father draws him (John 6:44,65), opens his heart (Acts 16:14), enables him to understand spiritual truth (John 6:45) (2 Corinthians 4:6), grants faith (Philippians 1:29), and repentance (2 Timothy 2:25).

    <h2>Outworked Salvation</h2>
    <p>
      Those who have truly been born again will begin a lifelong sanctification process. This process will end in glorification either at their death and entrance into God’s presence or at the return of Christ (1 John 3:2) (Philippians 1:6). True believers will have a changed life and will bear spiritual fruit (2 Corinthians 5:17) (John 15:8). Though they will struggle with sin in this life, they are no longer enslaved to it as they were before their conversion (Romans 6:6) (Romans 6:22).
    </p>
    <p>
      Christians are called to “work out their own salvation” because it is ultimately God who is at work in them, producing new desires and spiritual growth (Philippians 2:12-13). Those who have been saved are eternally secure and cannot lose their salvation (John 6:37-40) (Romans 8:30). Believers’ right standing before God is neither initially earned nor maintained by works (Romans 3:28) (Galatians 3:10-12), but is by grace alone, through faith alone, in Christ and His imputed righteousness alone (Ephesians 2:8-9) (Romans 5:19) (Philippians 3:9).

  <section id="conquering-grace">
    <h2>Conquering Grace</h2>
    <p>
      When God moves to save a person, His work in the person’s heart is effectual and always results in their coming to faith (John 6:44). This is clearly taught in Romans 8:30, where it says “those whom He called He also justified”. This does not mean that they are saved against their will, but rather that God changes their hearts and they come to Christ because they want to (Acts 16:14-15) (2 Corinthians 4:6). The joy that accompanies conversion in Scripture is hardly the result of being forced into becoming a Christian against one’s will (Acts 16:34). At the same time, people are not born again by their own will but by the will of God (John 1:13). Scripture teaches that it is God who causes people to be born again (1 Peter 1:3), and that He grants them faith (Philippians 1:29), and repentance (2 Timothy 2:25).
    </p>
    <p>
      There are several views on what is called the Ordo Salutis, or the order of salvation. The Ordo Salutis has to do with the order in which someone is born again and believes. This primarily concerns the logical, and not the temporal priority of regeneration and faith. It is helpful to think of temporal priority as the order in which something happens in time, and logical priority as describing an instrumental means by which something else takes place. For example, there is no temporal priority or order in someone being justified by faith. The very moment someone believes they are justified. However, there is a logical order because though they are simultaneous in time, faith is logically before justification because it is the instrumental means by which a person is justified. CROCUS allows for differing views on the logical order of regeneration and faith as long as one holds that both are gifts from God and are effectual.

  <section id="unconditional-election">
    <h2>Unconditional Election</h2>
    <p>
      The Bible teaches that God elects and predestines people to salvation and that He did so from eternity past (Ephesians 1:4-5). This election is not based on any foreseen good in the person or on anything the person will do (Romans 9:11). Rather, it is founded upon the sovereign plan and purpose of God (Ephesians 1:5) (Romans 9:22-23). God is not unjust for His choice to elect some rather than all (Romans 9:14). As Creator, He has the right to do with His creation as He sees fit (Romans 9:21). Further, people do not have the right to rebelliously question God’s ways (Romans 9:19-20). It is also important to remember that God is just and right in all He does (Deuteronomy 32:4) and that He never entices or forces anyone to sin (James 1:13). People choose to sin because they want to (James 1:14-15) and God is in no way complicit in this. Sinful people, not God, are responsible for their sin and rejection of the Gospel.
