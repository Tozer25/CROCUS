    <h1>The Six Points of CROCUS:</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">A Biblical Summary</p>

<section>
  <h2>Scripture Alone for Theology</h2>
  <p>
    It is crucial for Christians to draw their theology from Scripture alone. Scripture is the final and only authority with all matters of the faith, including formulating theology. Many theological systems have emphasized logic and philosophy over exegesis. Personal feelings and devotion to theological traditions often hinder believers from letting Scripture speak for itself. This results in the forcing of a system on the text, rather than the formation of a system from the text.
  </p>
  <p>
    CROCUS is a Biblically faithful, exegetically sourced and text-saturated theology. Every one of the six points is woven throughout the pages of Scripture and is not based on logic or a theological tradition. It is an excellent distillation of the Biblical teaching on soteriology. Though CROCUS is a system, it is tied to Scripture and cannot be divorced from it.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is not meant to be merely academic or classroom focused but is inherently practical and pastoral in nature. The system within itself is not important, but the Scripture that gives birth to it. The glorious Biblical truths that CROCUS highlights should be a cause for great joy, gratitude, humility, and holy living on the part of those who have experienced them.

    <h2>Outworked Salvation</h2>
    
<p>
  Those who have truly been born again will begin a lifelong sanctification process. This process will end in glorification either at their death and entrance into God’s presence or at the return of Christ (1 John 3:2) (Philippians 1:6). True believers will have a changed life and will bear spiritual fruit (2 Corinthians 5:17) (John 15:8). Though they will struggle with sin in this life, they are no longer enslaved to it as they were before their conversion (Romans 6:6) (Romans 6:22).
</p>
<p>
  Christians are called to “work out their own salvation” because it is ultimately God who is at work in them, producing new desires and spiritual growth (Philippians 2:12-13). Those who have been saved are eternally secure and cannot lose their salvation (John 6:37-40) (Romans 8:30). Believers’ right standing before God is neither initially earned nor maintained by works (Romans 3:28) (Galatians 3:10-12), but is by grace alone, through faith alone, in Christ and His imputed righteousness alone (Ephesians 2:8-9) (Romans 5:19) (Philippians 3:9).

  <section id="unconditional-election">
    <h2>Unconditional Election</h2>
    <p>
      The Bible teaches that God elects and predestines people to salvation and that He did so from eternity past (Ephesians 1:4-5). This election is not based on any foreseen good in the person or on anything the person will do (Romans 9:11). Rather, it is founded upon the sovereign plan and purpose of God (Ephesians 1:5) (Romans 9:22-23). God is not unjust for His choice to elect some rather than all (Romans 9:14). As Creator, He has the right to do with His creation as He sees fit (Romans 9:21). Further, people do not have the right to rebelliously question God’s ways (Romans 9:19-20). It is also important to remember that God is just and right in all He does (Deuteronomy 32:4) and that He never entices or forces anyone to sin (James 1:13). People choose to sin because they want to (James 1:14-15) and God is in no way complicit in this. Sinful people, not God, are responsible for their sin and rejection of the Gospel.
