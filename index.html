    <h2>What is CROCUS?</h2>
    <p>
      The Six Points of CROCUS present a historically Reformed, monergistic soteriological framework.
      It is similar to TULIP but introduces several important distinctions. While TULIP remains a widely used summary of Reformed soteriology, its terminology is often revised even by its own proponents due to potential misunderstandings. CROCUS seeks to express the historic Reformed view of salvation with greater theological precision and a practical, pastoral emphasis. It also offers a more faithful reflection of the Canons of Dort regarding the atonement and accommodates both high and moderate views. In doing so, it honors the rich history and diversity of the Reformed tradition.

    <h2>Why the Crocus?</h2>
    <p>
      The crocus flower has long been considered a symbol of hope, joy, and new life. It is one of the first flowers to bloom every year and often pushes up through the snow, announcing the end of winter and the beginning of spring. It is a wonderful illustration of spiritual rebirth and the new life believers have in Christ.
